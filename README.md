## AMC-web

## [Demo](https://damp-journey-1990.herokuapp.com)


### AMC-web is a web implementation of the software [AMC(Auto Multiple Choice)](http://home.gna.org/auto-qcm/).

The first purpose of this project is be able to create questions from which we can create exams and generate a .tex file so it can be imported in AMC software for marking and other stuff.


### At the moment, the following features are supported :

* Register and login
* Question creation
* Question listing
* Exam creation
* LaTeX generation


Anyway, the implementation of those features is not done at 100%. Currently working on it.
